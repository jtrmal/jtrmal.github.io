abstract="In this paper, we describe a semi-supervised training method used to generalize the Air Traffic Control (ATC) speech recognizer. The paper introduces the problems and challenges in ATC English recognition, describes available datasets and ongoing research projects. The baseline recognition model is then used to recognize the unlabelled data from a publicly available source. We used the LiveATC community portal which records and archives the recordings of ATC communication near the airports. The recognized unlabelled data are filtered using the data selection procedure based on confidence scores and the recognition acoustic model is retrained to obtain a more general model. The results on accented Czech and French data are reported.",
